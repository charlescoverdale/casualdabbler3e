# R Cookbook for the Casual Dabbler (3rd edition)

This repo contains the code used to publish [R Cookbook for the Casual Dabbler (3rd edition)](https://charlescoverdale.github.io/casualdabbler3e/).

RCCD1e was originally published in 2020 as a side project during the COVID-19 lockdowns in Melbourne. A lot has changed in the R community since, and as such the 3rd edition includes significant revisions — including a move from Bookdown to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

The book is 100% written in R and published using Quarto.
